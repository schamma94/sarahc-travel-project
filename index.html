            <h2>Zermatt, Switzerland</h2>
            <h3>A beautiful town that puts a spell on you</h3>
            <p>
              Zermatt lies at the foot of the Matterhorn. The town's touristic
              development is closely linked to what is most probably the world's
              most famous mountain. The vacation destination is a car-free zone,
              has preserved its original character and offers nearly unlimited
              possibilities as far as excursions are concerned.
            </p>
            <p>
              Zermatt, in southern Switzerland’s Valais canton, is a mountain
              resort renowned for skiing, climbing and hiking. The town, at an
              elevation of around 1,600m, lies below the iconic, pyramid-shaped
              Matterhorn peak. Its main street, Bahnhofstrasse is lined with
              boutique shops, hotels and restaurants, and also has a lively
              après-ski scene.
